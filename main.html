		<p>Flowers are one of nature’s most beautiful creations. They come in many colors, shapes, and sizes, and each type has its own special fragrance. Flowers grow on plants and trees, adding beauty to gardens, parks, and homes. They attract bees, butterflies, and birds, helping in the process of pollination which produces fruits and seeds. People use flowers for decoration, gifts, and even in medicines and perfumes. They bring happiness, peace, and freshness to our surroundings and symbolize love, purity, and joy.</p>

		<p>Roses are among the most popular and beautiful flowers in the world. They come in many colors such as red, pink, yellow, and white, each having its own meaning — red for love, white for purity, yellow for friendship, and pink for admiration. Roses have a sweet fragrance and soft petals, but their stems often have thorns. They grow in gardens, parks, and even in pots at home. Roses are used in perfumes, decorations, and for expressing emotions on special occasions like Valentine’s Day and weddings. Because of their beauty and pleasant smell, roses are 
			often called the “Queen of Flowers.”</p>
